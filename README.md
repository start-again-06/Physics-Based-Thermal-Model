# Physics-Based-Thermal-Model
A physics-informed neural network approach is proposed for control-oriented building thermal modeling, combining data with physical laws to improve accuracy and reduce training data needs. The method predicts room temperature, power use, and hidden thermal states more reliably than standard neural networks.
