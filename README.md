A physics-informed neural network approach is proposed for control-oriented building thermal modeling, combining data with physical laws to improve accuracy and reduce training data needs. The method predicts room temperature, power use, and hidden thermal states more reliably than standard neural networks.

This work introduces a data-driven framework for developing control-oriented thermal models of buildings, with the overarching goal of reducing energy consumption costs while maintaining indoor temperatures within acceptable comfort boundaries. Traditional modeling approaches often rely on either physics-based white/gray-box models, which offer interpretability but limited flexibility, or purely data-driven neural network models, which provide expressive power but lack physical grounding. To bridge this gap, we propose a physics-informed neural network (PINN) methodology specifically tailored for building thermal modeling.

Our approach integrates measured data, known building parameters, and the fundamental physical principles that govern heat transfer and thermal dynamics within buildings. By embedding these physics constraints directly into the neural network architecture, the resulting models become both data-efficient and physically consistent. This enables the network not only to learn the temporal evolution of room temperature and power consumption, but also to estimate hidden thermal states such as the temperature of the building’s thermal mass across future time steps. These latent states play a crucial role in capturing long-term thermal behavior, which is essential for optimal control.

The main contributions of this work are threefold. First, we present two variants of physics-informed neural network architectures designed explicitly for control-oriented thermal modeling tasks. These architectures systematically incorporate physical laws into the learning process, ensuring that predictions adhere to realistic thermal dynamics. Second, we demonstrate that training these models requires significantly less data than conventional neural networks that do not incorporate physics, highlighting their data-efficiency. Third, we show that the proposed architectures consistently achieve more accurate long-horizon predictions compared to standard neural networks, making them particularly well suited for predictive control applications.

To validate these contributions, we conduct extensive experiments using both simulated and real-world datasets. The results confirm that physics-informed neural networks outperform traditional data-driven approaches in terms of robustness, accuracy, and data requirements. Together, these findings show that the proposed PINN-based modeling strategy is an effective and reliable solution for control-oriented building thermal modeling, offering a practical path toward smarter, energy-efficient building management systems.
